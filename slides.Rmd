Comparision of species diversity between insitu and NEON spectral data
========================================================
```{r load-helpers, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(raster)
library(rhdf5)
library(rgdal)
library(neonAOP)
library(rgeos)
library(magrittr)

```


## Question

Are the esitmates of insitu correlation with remote sensing data?

# Data Used and Preprocessing

```{r extracting plot data }

```




## Finding HDF5 files for the hyperspectral data 
```{r}

```

## get extents for each flight hyperspectral raster and each plot
```{r}

```

# get extents for each plot and draw on plot

```{r}


```

## evaluating sampled data
